# twitter_activation_monitor

Simple script to send Discord notifications as soon as someone reactivates his account. You can changes fields that appears in the Discord Embed if you want to make it lighter or not.

# What to update in code ? 

Username : change it to the one you wanna monitor.

Bearer token : Change it to your twitter bearer token. Get it [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) .

Discord webhook : Change it to you discord webhook of the channel you want updates to appear. See tutorial [here](https://help.dashe.io/en/articles/2521940-how-to-create-a-discord-webhook-url)

## Whats next ?

Stop spamming on the same delay as the api call rate. Or maybe change the way it pings, I thought about updating the embed and not sending an other one.

Check if multiple users would work the same, might have to update some things.
